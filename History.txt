---------------------------------------------------------------------

- improved Ethereum mining speed by 1-15% (depends on mining mode and card model, slower card - more speed improvement).
- added "-etha" option to select Ethereum algorithm optimized for your cards.
- added "-allcoins" option to support Ethereum forks mining.
- miner checks all Ethereum shares before sending them to the pool. You will be warned if some GPU finds invalid share, usually due to overclocking.

- "-tt" option now can set target temperature for every card individually.
- "-tt" option now can set static fan speeds.
- fixed issue with -cclock and -mclock options. However, AMD blocked underclocking for some reason, you can overclock only.

- option "-ethi" for values less than "4" now sets very low GPU load to avoid any freezes in Windows. The most low GPU load is "-ethi 0".
  Also "-ethi" now can set intensity for every card individually.
  You can also specify negative values, for example, "-ethi -8192", it exactly means "global work size" value that is used in official miner.
